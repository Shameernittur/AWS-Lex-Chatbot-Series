## The Project

In this chatbot series, I'm learning about how to create an interactive chatbot using Amazon Lex. By the end of the 5 projects, I will have I'm building an intelligent chatbot to understand and master conversational AI workflows and automated data collection. I am building an IT Help Desk assistant to solve a real-world problem: gathering critical variables (like device type, location, and severity) efficiently. This project allows me to bridge the gap between cloud infrastructure and user-facing automation, ensuring that a simple user input is converted into a structured, actionable data package for technical teams.

## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside 5 to 7 hours of this week to work on this project series. I will keep myself accountable by documenting my progress daily on a GitHub repository and sharing a weekly update on my learning journey. My reward for completing this chatbot series will be deploying the bot live and treating myself to a high-quality certification course or a celebratory dinner for successfully mastering a new AWS skill.

### What is AI in chatbots?

AI-powered chatbots use several AI technologies to create natural feeling conversations with the end users. The key technologies that make this possible are NLP ( Natural language processing) to understand what you are saying, Generative AI to create helpful answers, Speech recognition to capture input given through speech.

### How does Amazon Lex simplify chatbot development?

Building chatbots traditionally requires three major phases( NLP, Dialog management and Integration) - each phase is a big chunk of work which will needs specialized experts in machine learning, linguistics, and conversational design, plus months of development time and lots of computing resources. Amazon Lex simplifies this by eliminating most of the complexity and turns chatbot building from taking months to just hours
